    "Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision trees can be used in many different classification problems. One real world example of decision trees are in the detecting microcalcifications in mammography as described [here](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees are extremely simple to implement, and interpret. They have the added advantage of being non parametric meaning they are robust against outliers and cases where the data is not linearly seperable. Additionally, they don't suffer from issues of high dimensionality like KNN. Finally, they require almost no data preparation unlike linear regressions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees are prone to overfitting and as such may not generalize well unless we use techniques like pruning. This is often why Random Forests are used instead of Decision Trees. Additionally, Decision Trees can become extremely large for certain datasets leading to a large tree that may be too large to store easily in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a good candidate as we are doing simple classification and should be able to easily fit the full tree in memory given the number of features. Additionally, they should be a good starting point for a benchmark of sorts given how easy they are to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting, a type of ensemble method, is used to improve character recognition in OCR (Optical Character Recognition).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble methods give you a lot of flexibility as they are agnostic to the weak learners you use. Additionally boosting, in particular, is great at avoiding overfitting as in many cases, when you increase the sample size, your confidence increases while your error either goes down or stays constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the disadvantages of boosting, and other ensemble methods, is that they can require some parameter tuning (such as learning rate) which make them harder to implement. However, in the boosting case this can be overcome by using something like ADABOOST.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble methods, in particular, random forests are often are often great at classification problems (which our problem domain is in). Random Forests, thanks to being an ensemble method, prevent the overfitting often associated with decision trees while preserving the relative simplicity and speed. Ensemble methods, especially Random Forests, are also a great fit for this dataset as the dataset is fairly high dimensional (48 features) and random forests handle this very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs have been used successfully in text classification problems (see [here](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6080/H09/documents/papers/svm_tutorial.ppt) )\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM does well when the data size is fairly small (as in our case!) and when the data is linearly separable on some kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM does poorly for large datasets as it has a large time and space complexity. Additionally, SVMs are sometimes hard to use as it can difficult to choose the right kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs are a good fit for this data as this is a classification problem and the dataset is very small (395) so it is realistic to actually implement it on this dataset."

    "It seems that the best model here is a Gradient Boosting Classifier for a variety of reasons. First of all, I wouldn't worry about the training times or the prediction times as the dataset is so small and everything is less than 0.1 seconds. Given that, our main focus should be the model that gives a strong F1 Score without overfitting. Gradient Boosting Classifiers have an F1 score that increases with training size indicating we are not overfitting our model. Additionally, it has one of the strongest F1 scores at 0.7727 (only exceeded by SVM at training size 100 and training size 200). Again, the training time of this classifier is consistently the highest but given how small this dataset is it's not a cause for concern. If we are to apply this model on a much larger dataset - perhaps for students across the country, then I would recommend trying a different model type potentially.\n",
    "\n",

    "A Gradient Boosting algorithm is one of a set of learning methods known as \"Ensemble Learning\" in Machine Learning. Ensemble Learning just means that instead of using one model, you use a bunch of different models and allow them to vote on what they think is the best solution. The logic behind these models is often times a single model may not understand the data as well as a set of different models with different perspectives. One way to think about it is a PTA (Parent - Teacher) committee for a school. Each parent brings a different idea of viewpoint and together, they can come to a better decision than just one person alone. Why is that? This is because when we look at their viewpoint together, they cancel out each other's biases and allow the school do understand all parts of the student and parent body's problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, a gradient boosting algorithm first chooses a random subset of students in the dataset, and then finds a rule that classifies students in that group. It then looks at where it did badly and tries to choose another subset where it has students where the earlier model did a poor job classifying. Given this new subset, it then tries to once again find a rule that classifies students in the new subset and so on and so forth. At the end, we combine these rules to create our classifier. Not all rules are given an equal vote, and those that do a better job of classifying are given a larger vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained by passing in a subset of our students and their outcomes. We then test whether this model does a good job by checking whether the generated rules work well on the subset not passed in to the training procedure. The model makes a prediction by looking at a student, understanding his or her attributes, and then, using a rule that works on these attributes, generating a prediction for whether or not the student is at risk."
